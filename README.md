SimpleCalc
==========

SimpleCalc is a basic set C# and VB.NET demo projects.  I use this in various introductory settings to demonstrate how .NET makes it easy to create re-usable code as well as how you can use .NET to create applications that run on a variety of platforms (console, desktop, tablet, phone, web, etc).
